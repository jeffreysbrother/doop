# Doop

Duplicate a directory and assign it a new name!

### example

```bash
# general
node doop.js <directory-to-copy> <new-dir-name>

# specific
node doop.js ga-33 jc-01
```

The copying is carried out recursively, so all nested directories and files will be found within the newly-created parent directory.
